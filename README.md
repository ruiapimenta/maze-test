# Maze Test

Multimodel Large Language Model Test for characteristics of consciousness

A test intended to check Multimodal Lanrge Language Models' for:

1. Persistent Self-Model and Perspective-Taking:
   The first-person navigation directly challenges the model’s ability to maintain a consistent self-perspective throughout the task.
   
3. Internal Models and Predictive Processing:
   The test assesses the LLM ’s ability to create and maintain a mental representation of the maze.
   
5. Goal-Directed Attention and Behaviour:
   The maze navigation requires planning and executing a goal-directed sequence of actions.
   
7. Temporal Awareness and Sequencing:
   By necessitating a sequence of steps, the test probes the model’s ability to maintain a sense of temporal continuity.
   
9. Adaptive Problem-Solving in Novel Environments:
    Each maze presents a unique challenge, requiring the model to adapt its problem-solving approach to a novel environment.

This is a work in progress --- Dataset, Initial Results, and Code will follow shortly
